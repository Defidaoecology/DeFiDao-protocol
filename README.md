DeFiDao Protocol
=================

The DeFiDao Protocol is an Ethereum smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the cToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain *supply* capital (Ether or ERC-20 tokens) to receive cTokens or *borrow* assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The DeFiDao cToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.

Contributing to the DeFiDao protocol is a bit different than most open-source projects

Contracts
=========

We detail a few of the core contracts in the DeFiDao protocol.

<dl>
  <dt>CToken, CErc20 and CEther</dt>
  <dd>The DeFiDao cTokens, which are self-contained borrowing and lending contracts. CToken contains the core logic and CErc20 and CEther add public interfaces for Erc20 tokens and ether, respectively. Each CToken is assigned an interest rate and risk model (see InterestRateModel and snktroller sections), and allows accounts to *mint* (supply capital), *redeem* (withdraw capital), *borrow* and *repay a borrow*. Each CToken is an ERC-20 snkliant token where balances represent ownership of the market.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>snktroller</dt>
  <dd>The risk model contract, which validates permissible user actions and disallows actions if they do not fit certain risk parameters. For instance, the snktroller enforces that each borrowing user must maintain a sufficient collateral balance across all cTokens.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>snk</dt>
  <dd>The DeFiDao Governance Token (snk). Holders of this token have the ability to govern the protocol via the governor contract.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Governor Alpha</dt>
  <dd>The administrator of the DeFiDao timelock contract. Holders of snk token may create and vote on proposals which will be queued into the DeFiDao timelock and then have effects on DeFiDao cToken and snktroller contracts. This contract may be replaced in the future with a beta version.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>InterestRateModel</dt>
  <dd>Contracts which define interest rate models. These models algorithmically determine interest rates based on the current utilization of a given market (that is, how much of the supplied assets are liquid versus borrowed).</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Careful Math</dt>
  <dd>Library for safe math operations.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>ErrorReporter</dt>
  <dd>Library for tracking error codes and failure conditions.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Exponential</dt>
  <dd>Library for handling fixed-point decimal numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>SafeToken</dt>
  <dd>Library for safely handling Erc20 interaction.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>WhitePaperInterestRateModel</dt>
  <dd>Initial interest rate model, as defined in the Whitepaper. This contract accepts a base rate and slope parameter in its constructor.</dd>
</dl>

Installation
------------
To run DeFiDao, pull the repository from GitHub and install its dependencies. You will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) installed.

    git clone https://github.com/Defidaoecology/DeFiDao-protocol
    cd DeFiDao-protocol
    yarn install --lock-file # or `npm install`

REPL
----

The DeFiDao Protocol has a simple scenario evaluation tool to test and evaluate scenarios which could occur on the blockchain. This is primarily used for constructing high-level integration tests. The tool also has a REPL to interact with local the DeFiDao Protocol (similar to `truffle console`).

    yarn repl -n development
    yarn repl -n rinkeby

    > Read CToken cBAT Address
    Command: Read CToken cBAT Address
    AddressV<val=0xAD53863b864AE703D31b819d29c14cDA93D7c6a6>


Testing
-------
Jest contract tests are defined under the [tests directory](https://github.com/Defidaoecology/DeFiDao-protocol/tree/master/tests). To run the tests run:

    yarn test

Integration Specs
-----------------

There are additional tests under the [spec/scenario](https://github.com/Defidaoecology/DeFiDao-protocol/) folder. These are high-level integration tests based on the scenario runner depicted above. The aim of these tests is to be highly literate and have high coverage in the interaction of contracts.

Formal Verification Specs
-------------------------

The DeFiDao Protocol has a number of formal verification specifications, powered by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/). You can find details in the [spec/formal](https://github.com/Defidaoecology/DeFiDao-protocol/) folder. The Certora Verification Language (CVL) files included are specifications, which when with the Certora CLI tool, produce formal proofs (or counter-examples) that the code of a given contract exactly matches that specification.

Deploying a CToken from Source
------------------------------

Note: you will need to set `~/.ethereum/<network>` with your private key or assign your private key to the environment variable `ACCOUNT`.

Note: for all sections including Etherscan verification, you must set the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` to a valid API Key from [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/apis).

To deploy a new cToken, you can run the `token:deploy`. command, as follows. If you set `VERIFY=true`, the script will verify the token on Etherscan as well. The JSON here is the token config JSON, which should be specific to the token you wish to list.

```bash
npx saddle -n rinkeby script token:deploy '{
  "underlying": "0x577D296678535e4903D59A4C929B718e1D575e0A",
  "snktroller": "$snktroller",
  "interestRateModel": "$Base200bps_Slope3000bps",
  "initialExchangeRateMantissa": "2.0e18",
  "name": "DeFiDao Kyber Network Crystal",
  "symbol": "cKNC",
  "decimals": "8",
  "admin": "$Timelock"
}'
```

If you only want to verify an existing token an Etherscan, make sure `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is set and run `token:verify` with the first argument as the token address and the second as the token config JSON:

```bash
npx saddle -n rinkeby script token:verify 0x19B674715cD20626415C738400FDd0d32D6809B6 '{
  "underlying": "0x577D296678535e4903D59A4C929B718e1D575e0A",
  "snktroller": "$snktroller",
  "interestRateModel": "$Base200bps_Slope3000bps",
  "initialExchangeRateMantissa": "2.0e18",
  "name": "DeFiDao Kyber Network Crystal",
  "symbol": "cKNC",
  "decimals": "8",
  "admin": "$Timelock"
}'
```

Finally, to see if a given deployment matches this version of the DeFiDao Protocol, you can run `token:match` with a token address and token config:

```bash
npx saddle -n rinkeby script token:match 0x19B674715cD20626415C738400FDd0d32D6809B6 '{
  "underlying": "0x577D296678535e4903D59A4C929B718e1D575e0A",
  "snktroller": "$snktroller",
  "interestRateModel": "$Base200bps_Slope3000bps",
  "initialExchangeRateMantissa": "2.0e18",
  "name": "DeFiDao Kyber Network Crystal",
  "symbol": "cKNC",
  "decimals": "8",
  "admin": "$Timelock"
}'
```

## Deploying a CToken from Docker Build
---------------------------------------

To deploy a specific version of the DeFiDao Protocol, you can use the `token:deploy` script through Docker:

```bash
docker run --env ETHERSCAN_API_KEY --env VERIFY=true --env ACCOUNT=0x$(cat ~/.ethereum/rinkeby) DeFiDaofinance/DeFiDao-protocol:latest npx saddle -n rinkeby script token:deploy '{
  "underlying": "0x577D296678535e4903D59A4C929B718e1D575e0A",
  "snktroller": "$snktroller",
  "interestRateModel": "$Base200bps_Slope3000bps",
  "initialExchangeRateMantissa": "2.0e18",
  "name": "DeFiDao Kyber Network Crystal",
  "symbol": "cKNC",
  "decimals": "8",
  "admin": "$Timelock"
}'
```

To match a deployed contract against a given version of the DeFiDao Protocol, you can run `token:match` through Docker, passing a token address and config:

```bash
docker run --env ACCOUNT=0x$(cat ~/.ethereum/rinkeby) DeFiDaofinance/DeFiDao-protocol:latest npx saddle -n rinkeby script token:match 0xF1BAd36CB247C82Cb4e9C2874374492Afb50d565 '{
  "underlying": "0x577D296678535e4903D59A4C929B718e1D575e0A",
  "snktroller": "$snktroller",
  "interestRateModel": "$Base200bps_Slope3000bps",
  "initialExchangeRateMantissa": "2.0e18",
  "name": "DeFiDao Kyber Network Crystal",
  "symbol": "cKNC",
  "decimals": "8",
  "admin": "$Timelock"
}'
```
